# Personalized Rendering Variant

## Idea 

I see rendering variant as different component compare to traditional Sitecore renderings. Currently Sitecore supports personalization on Renderings directly but not Rendering Variants. You can still achieve the personalization within the rendering variant, but not between the variants.

## Solution

This solution will allow a content author to personalize the rendering with the available variants through the personalization dialogue screen.

If rendering variant personalization has been setup by the content author, then whenever personalization rule matches it will apply the rendering variant setting to the given component at runtime.


## Doesn't Support

Experience Editor: A user cannot see the variant applied when they change the personalization from the dropdown list during edit mode.
